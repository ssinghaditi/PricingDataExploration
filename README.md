# PricingDataExploration
The way the startup company has typically gone about collecting data is by gathering consumer willingness to pay for products. This is achieved through surveys. Due to surveys being labor-intensive and time-consuming, they are beginning to explore other potential data collection methods, and proxies for willingngess to pay.																				
One proposal is to gather competitor prices for comparable products. However, their analytics team is not sure if competitor prices will serve as a valid subsitute for consumer data. If yes, what will be the best way to estimate the demand given the competitor prices with or without consumer data?
Questions to answer:						
  - Are there any findings regarding the WTP data? In your opinion, can these be generalized to the population?								
  - Is there any relationship between demand and price given the data? Any model can be built to esimate the demand?								
  - Any suggestions to use competitors' prices to improve demand estimate?
